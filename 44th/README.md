- **Description:** I was walking down the street when I spotted a picture of the 44th President, a figure widely known and recognized. Despite my disinterest in politics, I couldn't help but feel compelled by the image's iconic status. I decided to draw it, not out of personal admiration, but rather as a testament to the enduring influence of public figures. This impromptu sketch serves as a reflection of the cultural significance surrounding individuals like the 44th President, irrespective of personal views or affiliations.
- **Medium:** In rendering the portrait of the 44th President, I employed a unique technique involving patterns to delineate areas of varying darkness and texture. Utilizing a range of abstract patterns, I created a visual interplay of light and shadow, particularly accentuating the intricacies of the jacket with distinct forms and motifs. This approach allowed for a nuanced portrayal, infusing the portrait with depth and dimension while offering a distinctive and engaging interpretation.
- **Highlights:** I employed rulers to mark specific points on the paper, aiding in the precise rendition of the picture. This method facilitated accuracy and ensured that proportions were maintained throughout the drawing process. By using rulers, I aimed to achieve a high level of detail and realism in capturing the subject's likeness.
