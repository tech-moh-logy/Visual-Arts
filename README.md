## 🎭 Art Projects  

### 🏆 44th President | *1st Place out of 470+ Students*  
<div align="center">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%">
        <p>🖌️ <strong>Medium:</strong> Abstract Pattern Technique</p>
        <p>📌 <strong>Highlights:</strong> Precision markings using rulers for proportional accuracy</p>
        <p>I stumbled upon a portrait of the *44th President* while walking and was inspired to sketch it, not as a political statement but as an artistic study of a well-known public figure. I employed a unique shading technique using patterns to create depth and contrast.</p>

### 🏁 Bugatti Chiron | *Top 3 out of 650+ Students*  
<div align="center">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%">
        <p>🖌️ <strong>Medium:</strong> Graphite & Charcoal</p>
        <p>📌 <strong>Highlights:</strong> Dynamic shading with varying pencil weights</p>
        <p>Sunlight bathed my charcoal-stained fingertips as I refined the details of this *Bugatti Chiron* sketch—a tribute to both speed and family legacy. I meticulously blended different shades to capture the car's elegance and intensity.</p>
