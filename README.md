## Art Projects
### [44th President](#)
- **Description:** I was walking down the street when I spotted a picture of the 44th President, a figure widely known and recognized. Despite my disinterest in politics, I couldn't help but feel compelled by the image's iconic status. I decided to draw it, not out of personal admiration, but rather as a testament to the enduring influence of public figures. This impromptu sketch serves as a reflection of the cultural significance surrounding individuals like the 44th President, irrespective of personal views or affiliations.
- **Medium:** In rendering the portrait of the 44th President, I employed a unique technique involving patterns to delineate areas of varying darkness and texture. Utilizing a range of abstract patterns, I created a visual interplay of light and shadow, particularly accentuating the intricacies of the jacket with distinct forms and motifs. This approach allowed for a nuanced portrayal, infusing the portrait with depth and dimension while offering a distinctive and engaging interpretation.
- **Highlights:** I employed rulers to mark specific points on the paper, aiding in the precise rendition of the picture. This method facilitated accuracy and ensured that proportions were maintained throughout the drawing process. By using rulers, I aimed to achieve a high level of detail and realism in capturing the subject's likeness.

### [Buggati Chiron](#)
- **Description:** Sunlight bathes my charcoal-stained fingertips as I study the Bugatti Chiron sketched on paper. Each stroke echoes the raw power and elegance of the car, a testament to years of dedication. This sketch isn't just about the car; it's a tribute to my grandfather, who fueled my passion for speed. With each line, I feel his presence guiding me forward on this endless highway of dreams.
- **Medium:** I meticulously shaded the Bugatti Chiron sketch using a variety of light pencils, each with different levels of color intensity and thickness. By carefully selecting and blending these pencils, I aimed to capture the intricate details and dynamic contrasts that define the car's sleek design.
- **Highlights:** Key features or techniques used in the artwork.
