## üé≠ Art Projects  

### üèÜ [44th President](#) | *1st Place out of 470+ Students*  
üñåÔ∏è **Medium:** Abstract Pattern Technique  
üìå **Highlights:** Precision markings using rulers for proportional accuracy  

I stumbled upon a portrait of the *44th President* while walking and was inspired to sketch it, not as a political statement but as an artistic study of a well-known public figure. I employed a unique shading technique using patterns to create depth and contrast.
