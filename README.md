        <p>📌 <strong>Highlights:</strong> Futuristic UI aesthetics, geometric precision, and branding integration</p> 
        <p>New York City's skyline hums with energy, much like the inspiration behind <b>CORE</b>—a conceptual branding piece for Con Edison.

      <td width="50%">
  <p>🎨 <strong>Medium:</strong> Digital Design & Branding</p>
  <p>📌 <strong>Highlights:</strong> Sculpted visual elements, powerful typography mirroring his physique, and a high-energy aesthetic celebrating fitness and War 2.</p>
  <p><b>HRX</b>, a graphic design exploration for Hrithik Roshan's activewear, draws direct inspiration from his iconic physique. His famously chiseled body and sculpted abs serve as a visual foundation, translated into strong, clean lines and impactful forms throughout the design. The muscular arms, a symbol of his dedication to fitness, are reflected in the powerful and dynamic typography. This branding concept pulses with the same high-octane energy and anticipation surrounding his upcoming movie, War 2, a sequel to the blockbuster hit. It's a visual celebration of peak physical condition and the thrilling action Hrithik Roshan embodies.</p>
